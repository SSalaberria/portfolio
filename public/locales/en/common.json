      "description": "Hey there! I&apos;m Sebastián, a software developer with an affinity for all things related to web development. I&apos;ve been creating things on the internet since my teenage years, toying around with game APIs and Python scripts. Fast forward to today, I&apos;ve got studies in software engineering, and I&apos;ve gained valuable work experience as a developer under my belt. <br /> <br /> Most of my work experience has been focused on frontend development, making it the best skill in my toolbox. However, I love to dabble on both sides of development, especially when it comes to personal projects with the MERN stack. <br /> <br /> I&apos;m a firm believer in constantly learning and evolving, and I always strive to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends. When I&apos;m not busy coding, chances are you can find me lifting weights, swimming or playing some video games."
